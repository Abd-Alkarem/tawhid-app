## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Your app needs BOTH frontend and backend:**
- Frontend (React): Port 3000
- Backend (Node server): Port 3001

The `vercel.json` file I created will handle both automatically.

### Environment Variables

If deploying to production, you may need to set:
- `PORT` for the server
- Any API keys you're using

### After Deployment

Share the URL with anyone! They can access it from anywhere in the world. üåç

Example: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

## Testing Locally Before Deploy

Make sure everything works:
```bash
npm run build
npm run server
```

Then open `http://localhost:3001` to test the production build.
